# Python-ML-Sklearn
Here use multiple algorithms from the scikit-learn library to solve classification (Pimas Indians dataset) and regression (Boston Housing Prices dataset) problems. Use specific algorithms from sklearn for each type of problem and compare their results. Programs also output a best performing algorithms along with a box &amp; whisker plot.
